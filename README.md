Waveshaper
==========

WORK IN PROGRESS!

A simple proof of concept implementation of a tool that draws waveforms, done in python.
This is a simple way to play around with architecture before implementing the thing in
a stricter language.

It draws huge inspiration (wave shapes, drawing methodology) from the tikz-timing package by Martin Scharrer.
